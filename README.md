Calling friends is hard.

Calling is hard:
anxiety about interrupting people
itâ€™s hard to maintain a mental list of people to call
It feels like picking and choosing between your friends and it doesn't feel good
You can't do other things while you wait for people to pick up
You have to be on your phone to call and that gets distracting
People not picking up is hard. It feels like rejection

What if you can just call a friend when you press a key?

The app would go through a queue that you set up and call each friend in order. Whether the friend answers or not, they're placed into the end of the queue. When you call them their phone does not ring. It just shows a notification for a while. Maybe a minute or 5, and then silently disappears without leaving a record that you called them. 

This way you press a key, and just wait for a friend to pick up.
